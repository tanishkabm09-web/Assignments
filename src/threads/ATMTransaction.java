/*
ℹ️code explanation
Initially the thread is in the new state.After calling start(),it moves to RUNNABLE and executes the run() method.
The exact timing of the state changes depends on the JVM Scheduler.
ℹ️Points to remember:
⭐Thread is created once.
⭐start() changes state.
⭐thread cannot be restarted.
⭐final state is terminated or dead.*/
